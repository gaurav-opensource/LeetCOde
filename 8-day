                                                 Graph Basics:
                                                  Understand graph representation (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
                                                   Learn about graph traversal techniques:
Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Depth-First Search (DFS).
Graph Problems:
Solve problems on:
Detecting cycles in an undirected and directed graph.
Finding connected components.
Shortest path problems (using BFS for unweighted graphs).
Key Problems: Graph coloring, topological sorting.
